# Sentiment Analysis Project
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. The main goal is to classify the sentiment of a given text into positive, negative, or neutral categories. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) detailing the entire process from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Illustrates the steps taken to clean and prepare the text data for analysis, including tokenization, removing stopwords, and vectorization.
Model Training: Details the process of selecting and training a machine learning model suitable for sentiment analysis.
Evaluation: Discusses the methods used to evaluate the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Visualization: Includes visualizations of the data and the model's performance metrics for better understanding and analysis.
# Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and evaluation.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and stopwords removal.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
